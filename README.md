## Overview

Just added the  Service and Sub-Container based Classes from my CombatService in my game as an example of work.
RBXM is just the full module with all of these under it.

```bash
curl -O https://github.com/PrismStudioRBLX/Roblox-Modules/raw/refs/heads/main/CombatService.rbxm
```
## PS

I didn't really know what to upload so I just picked something random out of a game I had.
